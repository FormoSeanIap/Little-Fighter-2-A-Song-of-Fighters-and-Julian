# Little-Fighter-2-A-Song-of-Fighters-and-Julian
This is the game modified from Little Fighter 2, a popular freeware PC fighting game for Windows created by  Marti Wong and Starsky Wong in 1999.

1. Introduction

(1) Little Fighter 2, A Song of Fighters and Julian (abbrieviated as LF2-SFJ), is a game modified from Little Fighter 2, a popular freeware PC fighting game for Windows created by  Marti Wong and Starsky Wong in 1999.
  
(2) It is named after the story of the stage mode which is the main feature of this game.
  
(3) This mod features on making characters unique, and the change of stage.
  
(4) This mod uses the system from 艾爾卡特.(http://ztage.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=13548)

2. Features

(1) Characters Uniqueness

In the original LF2, every character is unique and special in his own way. I want to increase this uniqueness, so that players will have to make strategic decisions when they pick characters. 

For example, Louis’ armor is strengthened, but he is yet slower. You will want to pick him while facing Rudolf, since it is hard for Rudolf to break his armor. But Louis will be weak against Davis who is good at one-on-one fighting. On the other hand, Davis will be weak against Rudolf since he can never catch the real Rudolf, since I make Rudolf more powerful in hiding and cloning.   

(2) Stage Mode
  
I try to make a story in the stage mode, featuring the epic fight between Fighters and Julian. It begins after the defeat of Julian and his resurrection.

5. Bugs already found(without good ways to improve)

(1) Recording files have big chances to be error when playing after restarting the game.(big problem)

(2) In stage "Ritual of the Dusk 1", in the starting, there are natural disasters which originally should have show up only in background Queen Island.

(3) In stage "Ritual of the Dusk 2", at Resurrection, there may be a problem that the statues aren't clean.

(4) The bombs in stage may not explode in a big chance.(big problem)

(5) In the background Olympia, the three statues in the background may disappear for a short time.

(6) Characters' running speeds while hanging heavy objects are the same as running normally.

(7) The dash direction when crouch is different from original version.(details at the below in http://ztage.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1...&start=200

(8) If players enter a certain move before characters getting fallen, the characters will do the move after getting up for sure.

(9) There are problems in the character AI of using abilities.(I improve it by adding some move, but it is still apparent in some characters like Henry, Julian and Bat.)

(10) There are many blue places in the exe of black background.(I have no idea how to change it.), also in the loading screen.
